Display/show me this app (UI) if it's truly done

The migration from Lovable/Supabase to Replit's full-stack environment is complete. I have successfully:

Set up the backend infrastructure: Created an Express.js server with session-based authentication and a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.
Migrated the data model: Ported the Supabase tables (profiles, properties, enquiries) into a shared Drizzle schema.
Implemented API routes: Replaced Supabase client calls with secure server-side API endpoints for property management, user authentication, and enquiry submissions.
Integrated local storage: Replaced Supabase Edge Functions with a local file upload system using Multer for property images.
Updated the frontend: Refactored the authentication hook and all page components to communicate with the new Express backend.
Cleaned up: Removed the Supabase integration files and finalized the project configuration.
The application is now running on Replit's native stack. You can view the live UI in the webview.

[x] 1. Install the required packages
[x] 2. Restart the workflow to see if the project is working
[x] 3. Migrate Supabase to Neon Postgres
[x] 1. Move Supabase client calls to the server, use server-side PostgreSQL queries with Drizzle
[x] 2. Port Supabase Edge Functions into a server route
[x] 3. Secure API keys & env vars, use the ask_secret tool to ask the user for the secrets
[x] 4. Push the database schema using npm run db:push
[x] 5. Remove Supabase code
[x] 4. Verify the project is working using the feedback tool
[x] 5. Inform user the import is completed and they can start building, mark the import as completed using the complete_project_import tool
